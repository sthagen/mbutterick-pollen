@section{Bugs and feature requests}

Can be submitted as @link["https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen/issues"]{GitHub issues} at the main Pollen source repository.

@section{Questions & discussion}

For general tips and how-to questions, use the @link["https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen-users/issues"]{pollen-users discussion group} (on GitHub). I'll also use that list to post major changes and new features. 

You need a GitHub account to post. If you don't have one, don't panic — they're free and easy to set up with an email address. @link["https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen-users"]{Instructions here}.

(BTW, the former ``pollenpub'' Google Group is now deprecated.)

@section{Can I see the source for Practical Typography or Typography for Lawyers?}

Yes, the source for @link["http://typographyforlawyers.com/"]{Typography for Lawyers} is available. In terms of content, TFL was originally the basis of Practical Typography. But in terms of code, this new TFL website is essentially a clone of Practical Typography, but rewritten to be clearer and more instructive, with extensive source comments.
